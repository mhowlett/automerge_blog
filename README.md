## Playing with automerge

a project that uses automerge in the browser.

you'll need node + npm installed. brew or not to brew. I don't, and don't remember problems.

to install dependencies:

> npm i

to start a webserver listening on localhost:8080 (auto-builds the bundle.js IIRC):

> npm start 

to build without starting webserver:

> npm bld

this writes to console in the brower. to open that hold down 'option' + 'cmd' and press 'i'.
